The aim of my PhD is to explore the intriguing intersection between deterministic optimization and the Bayesian framework,
which have historically been divergent. Through my research, I have contributed to the advancement of Bayesian algorithms
by incorporating deterministic optimization techniques to improve their efficiency, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.
