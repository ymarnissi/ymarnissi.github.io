<p align="center">The aim of my Ph.D is to explore the intriguing intersection between deterministic optimization and the Bayesian framework,which have historically been divergent. Through my research, I have contributed to the advancement of Bayesian algorithms by incorporating deterministic optimization techniques to improve their efficiency, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.</p>
