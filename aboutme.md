<h1>About me. <br> </h1>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin:5px; font-weight:100;font-size:15px"> With a strong interest in statistics, probability theory, optimization, and machine learning, I have been a research engineer at the Mathematics and Algorithms for Temporal Data (MATD) Lab at SafranTech since September 2017. Prior to that, I was a PhD student at Gaspard Monge Institute in Gustave Eiffel University under the supervision of Jean-Christophe Pesquet and Emilie Chouzenoux. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin:5px; font-weight:100;font-size:15px"> My current work at SafranTech is centered on the application of Bayesian inference, machine learning and model-based signal processing for prognostics and diagnostics of aircraft engines. I am passionate about using my expertise in these areas to tackle real-world problems and make a positive impact. </p>
