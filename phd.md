My Ph.D. research aims to investigate the fascinating intersection between deterministic optimization and the Bayesian framework, two fields that have traditionally followed separate paths. By incorporating deterministic optimization techniques, my research has contributed to enhancing Bayesian algorithms' efficiency, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.

<h1>3MH sampling algorithm</h1>

<p>This is a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm using first and second order informations about the target density. </p>

<!--more-->

<p>It is a **Metropolis-Hastings** algorithm inspired from **Langevin dynamics**, where the drift term is preconditioned
by an adaptive matrix constructed through a **Majorization-Minimization** strategy. </p>
