<p align="center">
My Ph.D. research aims to investigate the fascinating intersection between <strong>deterministic optimization</strong>  and the <strong>Bayesian framework</strong> , two fields that have traditionally followed separate paths. By incorporating deterministic optimization techniques, my research has contributed to enhancing Bayesian algorithms' efficiency, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.

<p>This is the Majorize-Minimize adapted Metropolis-Hasting algorithm: a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm using derivatives informations about the target density. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It is a <strong>Metropolis-Hastings</strong> algorithm inspired from <strong>Langevin dynamics</strong>, where the drift term is preconditioned
by an adaptive matrix constructed through a <strong>Majorization-Minimization</strong> strategy. </p>

<center> <h2>auxiliary variables Gibbs sampler for high dimensional spaces</h2></center>
<p>This is a Gibbs sampler with a Data Augmentation approach.  It ddresses the problem of sampling from multivariable distributions when the variables of interest are strongly correlated with heterogeneous sources of dependencies preventing efficient sampling with standard algorithms.</p>
<!--more-->
<p> Auxliary variables are added to the model without changing the target marginal
distributions in such a way that simulation can be performed more efficiently
in the new larger space. </p>
