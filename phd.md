<p align="center">
My Ph.D. research aims to investigate the fascinating intersection between <strong>deterministic optimization</strong>  and the <strong>Bayesian framework</strong> , two fields that have traditionally followed separate paths. By incorporating deterministic optimization techniques, my research has contributed to enhancing Bayesian algorithms' efficiency, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.

<p>It is a <strong>Metropolis-Hastings</strong> algorithm inspired from <strong>Langevin dynamics</strong>, where the drift term is preconditioned
by an adaptive matrix constructed through a <strong>Majorization-Minimization</strong> strategy. </p>
